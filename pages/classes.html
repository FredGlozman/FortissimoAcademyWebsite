								<h3>Musical Curriculum</h3>
	
								<p class="main" align="center"><strong>Our music curriculum can be divided into three major streams.</strong></p>
	
								<p class="main" align="left"><strong>Individual Lessons</strong> are the foundation of music education. Students from pre-elementary to adult level have access to our highly qualified faculty, who teach every day of the week. We offer private instructions in piano, violin, guitar and voice.</p>
	
								<p class="main" align="left"><strong>Early Childhood Development</strong> is a program, which allows children to grow with music starting as early as one year old! To nurture this growth, Music Academy developed &ldquo;The Music Track&rdquo;, designed so that children can move progressively through several levels, each developmentally appropriate for a specific age group.</p>
	
								<p class="main" align="left"><strong>Ensembles and Group Classes</strong> is a program, which serves the purpose of introducing musical disciplines in a group setting.</p>
								
								<p class="main" align="center"><strong>All of our programs are delivered by artists and educators working in their respective disciplines as musicians, visual artists and theatre makers.&nbsp; Our teachers have a special talent to work with young people.</strong></p>
